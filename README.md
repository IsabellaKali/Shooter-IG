You need to download the ZIP where you tried downloading before, there's no release this time, also you need to download a python extension

So you'll need to open up CMD and type: pip install pygame
Have fun! :D

When you have it downloaded you open a CMD again or powershell and type "python mainGame.py" and hope it works LMAO <3
